# React Learning 

These are a series of simple code walkthroughs for an introduction to React.
This was originally prepared for a Lunch & Learn session.

## React is a Component Library
- Simple composition over inheritance 
- Utilizes virtual DOM
- Plays well with other frameworks
	
## Some core software engineering principles that are reinforced by the React Framework

- Single Responsibility Principle 
	- There should never be more than one reason for a class to change
- Don't Repeat Yourself 
	- Repetition breeds errors and waste
- Virtual DOM saves time
	- Updating the DOM is expensive and React is strategic about it
	- Monitors the values of current state
	- Determines the least expensive way to update the DOM
	- Compares the current setup to desired setup
