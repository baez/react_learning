"#react_learning" 


This is a series of code walkthroughs for learning React originally delivered as a Lunch & Learn by Behzad Karim


- React is a Component Library
	- Simple composition over inheritance 
	- Utilizes virtual DOM, fast
	- Plays well with other frameworks

	
- Core principles reinforced by the React Framework

  Single Responsibility Principle 
  - There should never be more than one reason for a class to change

  Don't Repeat Yourself 
  - Repetition breeds errors and waste


- Why React Virtual DOM saves time
	- Updating the DOM is expensive and React is strategic about it
		○ Monitors the values of current state
		○ Determines the least expensive way to update the DOM
		○ Compares the current setup to desired setup
