# React Learning 


These are a series of simple code walkthroughs for an introduction to React.
This was originally prepared for a Lunch & Learn React Intro session by G.B. Karim

- React is a Component Library
	- Simple composition over inheritance 
	- Utilizes virtual DOM, fast
	- Plays well with other frameworks

	
- Some of the core software engineering principles are reinforced by the React Framework

  Single Responsibility Principle 
  - There should never be more than one reason for a class to change

  Don't Repeat Yourself 
  - Repetition breeds errors and waste


- React's smart Virtual DOM saves time
	Updating the DOM is expensive and React is strategic about it
		○ Monitors the values of current state
		○ Determines the least expensive way to update the DOM
		○ Compares the current setup to desired setup
